 "description": "# Coupon Support\nGo to Help -> About and check that the Frappe and ERPNext versions are after v13.11.0 for compatible Pricing Rule support for Woocommerce discount coupons. Support at time of writing is only for transaction-based Pricing Rules, not per-Item.\n\nERPNext Sales Orders only support one coupon code:\n - the first Woocommerce Order `coupon_lines` `code` field must match the ERPNext `Coupon Code` `Coupon Name` field\n\n[**View PR**](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/pull/27423)",
